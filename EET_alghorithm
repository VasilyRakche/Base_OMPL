1)Data input:
Done as a part of Parse_OpenMesh>FCL
//Getting the data from file, and then converting it to fcl, returning a model
std::shared_ptr<Model> model. model is defined in FCL//

2) Function ValidityChecker for OpenMesh:
Done as a part of FCL_STATE_CHECK, because our model is in FCL and given the
state samples from OMPL, we are determening are they valid or not

2.1)Function for determening distance to collision
First we need to define in OMPL StateSpace, decide the boundries, put a goal and start sample.
We are defining everything in Base_OMPL.
In isValid_class
